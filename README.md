The objective in this experiment is to identify and apply various codes and functions from the Numpy library in creating a Python program.

## INSTRUCTIONS:
### PROBLEM 1: NORMALIZATION PROBLEM
Normalization is one of the most basic preprocessing techniques in data analytics.
This involves centering and scaling process. Centering means subtracting the data from the mean and scaling means dividing with its standard deviation.
Mathematically, normalization can be expressed as

</p>  
In Python, element-wise mean and element-wise standard deviation can be obtained by using .mean() and .std() calls.  
In this problem, create a random 5 x 5 ndarray and store it to variable X. Normalize X. Save your normalized
ndarray as *X_normalized.npy*

### PROBLEM 2: DIVISIBLE BY 3 PROBLEM
Create the following 10 x 10 ndarray.
